This project utilizes a single Raspberry Pi Pico to monitor and respond to high sound levels. The Raspberry Pi Pico is equipped with a sound sensor, button, LCD screen, buzzer, and motor. The sound sensor continuously monitors ambient noise, and when the noise exceeds a certain threshold, it triggers the alert system. The button serves as a manual override, allowing users to deactivate the alert system temporarily.
When the alert system is activated, the Raspberry Pi Pico displays a warning message on the LCD screen, sounds the buzzer, and activates the motor to create vibrations, alerting people to the high sound pollution levels.
